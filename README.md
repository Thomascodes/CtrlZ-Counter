# CtrlZ-Counter
A CRAZY basic program I wrote in 15 minutes (approximately)
Done for a friend who wanted this sort of thing


Okay, all this is does is log how many times you've pressed CTRL-Z using RegisterHotKey. Meaning it uses <windows.h>, meaning this IS NOT cross-platform.

Code is dirty, yes yes, dumb project, 15 minutes, yada yada
